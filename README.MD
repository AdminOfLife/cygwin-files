This repository contains cygwin1.dll (32-bit version) and its source code that we provide accodring to the Cygwin licensing terms.

cygwin1.dll is required to run Windows binaries of FormLink and Vermaseren's FORM. These binaries are distributed as a part of the FormLink installation.

**This is not an official provider for Cygwin and the owners of this repository are not related to Cygwin or its developers in any way**. 

The binaries available here are intended for the users of FormLink, a Mathematica package that allows to use FORM from a Mathematica session. We provide the binaries as a courtesy to those who might not be able to compile FormLink and FORM from source themselves and hence would not be able to use FormLink.

By downloading any binaries from here, you acknowledge that you have read the **conditions for the use of Cygwin** laid out here

https://cygwin.com/licensing.html

and that you agree to follow them. Otherwise, using the binaries would constitute a copyright violation!
